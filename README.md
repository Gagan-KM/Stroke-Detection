# Stroke Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a stroke detection model using logistic regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. The goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately identify whether a person is likely to have a stroke based on various health parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a comprehensive set of features including age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, BMI, and glucose levels among others. Each entry in the dataset is labeled as either having experienced a stroke (positive class) or not having a stroke (negative class).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset underwent thorough preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure optimal model performance.
   
2. **Feature Selection**: Feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance scores were used to select the most relevant features for training the model.

3. **Logistic Regression Model**: Logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, was chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The model was trained using the preprocessed dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the logistic regression model was evaluated using various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, ROC curve analysis and AUC-ROC scores were used to assess the model's predictive capability.

## Results
The trained logistic regression model demonstrated promising results in stroke detection, achieving high accuracy and robust performance across different evaluation metrics. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project successfully developed a stroke detection model using logistic regression, showcasing the potential of machine learning techniques in healthcare applications. The model's ability to accurately predict stroke risk based on patient information can aid healthcare professionals in early intervention and preventive care strategies. Further refinement and validation of the model on larger datasets can enhance its reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios.
