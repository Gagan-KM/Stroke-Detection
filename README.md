# Stroke Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a stroke detection model using logistic regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. The goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately identify whether a person is likely to have a stroke based on various health parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a comprehensive set of features including age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, BMI, and glucose levels among others. Each entry in the dataset is labeled as either having experienced a stroke (positive class) or not having a stroke (negative class).

## Results
The trained logistic regression model demonstrated promising results in stroke detection, achieving high accuracy and robust performance across different evaluation metrics. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project successfully developed a stroke detection model using logistic regression, showcasing the potential of machine learning techniques in healthcare applications. The model's ability to accurately predict stroke risk based on patient information can aid healthcare professionals in early intervention and preventive care strategies. Further refinement and validation of the model on larger datasets can enhance its reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios.
